Lab Tasks
=========

You can use the AUCA server for this work through SSH at 'auca.space'. The login
has the format `<last name>_<first letter of the first name>`.

## Lab #1, Find the Password

Proove that security by obscurity does not always work by finding passwords in the executables `1`, `2`, and `3` located
at `iuca-infosec` of your home directory on the `auca.space` server.

## Lab #2, Break the Cipher

Given the following [text](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19Q60HCDDswcSA_BvWlVV-Q641Vs2i1KA/view?usp=sharing), try break it by using at least two different approaches discussed during the class. Select one
approach and write a decryption function in Python for any text that uses the same symmetric encryption scheme.

Try using a Jupyter notebook. You can get one online for free at <https://notebooks.azure.com>.
